# My Projects

### This is a list of samples from professional and personal coding projects I've been involved in:

#### 1. [Collegiate Simplifier Project](https://github.com/PilatiEric/my-projects-and-portfolio/tree/main/Collegiate%20Simplifier%20Project)
   - The project involved creating a site to organize, simplify, and direct various financial and facility projects and orders for multiple campuses.
      We worked alongside the San Diego Community College District to ensure the product was designed to the needed specifications.
      Site maintenance is still supported while plans to market the site model to other collegiate institutes are being made.

#### 2. Passport MRZ Data Uploader (On Standby)
   - Once finished the site application will act as an invisible page on which data from an MRZ Scanner app will be sent. The backend will automatically
     decode, decrypt, and organize all information before inserting it into a SQL server. A sample will be uploaded on project completion.
