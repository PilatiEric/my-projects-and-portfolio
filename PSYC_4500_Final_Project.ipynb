    "# Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "*This section should read like a methods section of a journal article. Fill in the two sub-sections below.*\n",
    "\n",
    "## List generation\n",
    "\n",
    "*Provide enough detail (in words) about the list generation so that someone could recreate the list generation code themselves. Be sure to state all the specific parameters used, including number of stimuli per block and number of blocks. Refer to the list generation code we provided to find all the information you need.*\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Block Generation\n",
    "*To begin, there needs to be a method to handle creating the blocks. This includes the pure trial blocks for the Indoor and Outdoor pictures or the Positive, Negative, and Neutral words, as well as the mixed trials which include words or pictures from each group.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*To do this, the method will have to read in three arguments:*\n",
    "*1) The pools of words or pictures*\n",
    "*2) The cond(condition), so whether it's one of the \"pure\" or \"mixed\" trials*\n",
    "*3) The num_items(number of items) to specify how many words or pictures you want to appear*\n",
    "\n",
    "*You will also need to add some dicts to the list. One to specify is the novelty is a target or a lure and one to specify the condition of the test. Each study trial will start with only targets. These are the things that the subject needs to memorize. At the test trial, there needs to be an equal number of lures added to the list of items.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*Finally, the particular experiment needs to be decided. Regardless of whether the image or word experiment is chosen, the different pool files need to be read in. After that, go through and make sure that both pure and mixed trials can be produced. If the image test is chosen, this means that there needs to be tests with just indoor and just outdoor pictures as well as a test with both. If the word test is chosen, there needs to be a test for just negative words, just positive words, and just neutral words, as well as all types of words. On top of that, the list of items needs to be randomized at each iteration. This means that each time a trial is run, there should be different items in different order. Finally, no two trials should share any of the same items, so make sure that the words or images or removed once the trial is over.*\n",
    "\n",
    "## SMILE Experiment Details\n",
    "\n",
    "*Provide enough detail so that someone could implement the experiment presentation and response collection, including all timing information and how the blocks were structured and presented.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*For the image experiment, the subject will need two different buttons to press. One will be for if the image that pops up is a target (was in the original list) or is a lure (was just added to the list). They may be whatever key you choose, but they should preferably not be directly next to each other to avoid any confusion. These keys will also need to be used for a math section that will fall in the middle of each block in which one key will need to be pressed if an equation given is true and the other for if the equation given is false.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*To start, there needs to be an opening page explaining the experiment, along with the math compnent. Pressing any key should send them to the next screen asking if they're ready to begin. At the end of each trial and block as well as after each math component, the subject should be given a screen they can stay at until ready (which is shown by pressing any key) so they may have a break.* \n",
    "\n",
    "*There is also timing that needs to be accounted for. During the study trials the subject should have 1.5 seconds to study each image before it disappears. Also include 0.5 seconds of a space between each image as well as 0.5 seconds of jitter. Once they are done with the study trial, they are to be taken to the math section which will display an equation with an answer attached. They are to determine if the equation and matching answer are true or not. They will have 20 seconds to answer as many of these as possible. Once the math component is over, they should then be prompted to begin the test trial portion where they must identify the images from the original list and images just added. At the end of this, they should be given another break with a prompt allowing them to continue on to the next block.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*Once they have completed the number of blocks specified, there should be a screen to congratulate them on finishing.*"
